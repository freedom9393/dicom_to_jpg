<b>Note:</b> This repository is for converting .dcm (dicom) files to .jpg (grayscale) file using Python. It doesn't extract
patient's information, it only converts .dcm images to .jpg images
Please change following lines in convert_dcm_to_jpg.py file and run it:

in_path = "D:\\Projects\\Proba\\DCM" # Folder to read .dcm images from
out_path = "D:\\Projects\\Proba\\JPG" # Folder that will be created and stored new .jpg images
